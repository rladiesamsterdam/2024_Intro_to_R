# Introduction to R workshop
An [R-Ladies Amsterdam](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-amsterdam/) event.

## Repository Contents
This repository contains the materials for the Introduction to R workshop. The repository contains the following files:

- **Intro_to_R_presentation.pdf**: workshop slides that present material on four areas of R programming: 1) basic R operations, 2) data types and basic data manipulation, 3) plotting in base R, and 4) an introduction to ggplot2 for more advanced graphics. These slides borrow heavily from the Introduction to R [book](https://intro2r.com/) by Alex Douglas, Deon Roos, Francesca Mancini, Ana Couto & David Lusseau. These slides are not exhaustive and we encourage workshop participants to seek out other resources for more information, such as [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) and [ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis](https://ggplot2-book.org/).
- **Intro_to_R.Rmd**: this [R markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) file contains exercises for each section of the presentation for workshop participants to practice using R on their own.
- **flower.xls**: this is an Excel data file that is used throughout the presentation to illustrate many R capabilities.
